Overview

The AI Fitness Voice Assistant project is designed to make workout sessions more interactive and accessible by allowing users to control workouts via voice commands, receive real-time feedback, and follow personalized training plans. It’s ideal for home workouts, busy schedules, or anyone wanting trainer-level guidance without needing a physical trainer.

Features

Voice command support to start, pause, or switch workouts

Guided workout routines tailored to user’s fitness level and goals

Real-time feedback and cues (e.g., pace, count, rest) via voice

Progress tracking (reps, sets, duration)

Multilingual support (if implemented)

Clean, responsive UI for workouts, summaries, and history

Technologies Used

Frontend: React (or specify if using Next.js, etc.)

Voice / Speech Recognition: Web Speech API / SpeechRecognition / other services

State Management: React hooks / Context API (or specify)

Backend (if any): (Optional — mention if you have any API)

Hosting: Netlify (frontend live demo)

Other tools: dayjs, CSS-in-JS or CSS modules, etc.

How It Works

User opens the app via browser (mobile or desktop).

The assistant prompts for voice permissions.

User chooses a workout or issues voice command such as “Start 10-minute cardio.”

Assistant walks through each exercise, counting reps, giving voice cues (rest, next exercise).

After workout, assistant presents summary of performance (time, reps, maybe caloric burn).

User can repeat, skip, or modify workout via voice or UI.

Installation & Local Setup

To run the project locally:

# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-fitness-voice-assistant.git
cd ai-fitness-voice-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn

# Optional: if there is backend
cd backend
npm install

# Return to frontend
cd ..

# Start development server
npm start

# Access at localhost:3000 (or as specified)


If using environment variables, create a .env file with:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # optional
REACT_APP_LANGUAGE=en                   # optional

Usage Instructions

Click “Authorize Microphone” when prompted.

Use voice commands like “Start workout”, “Pause”, “Next exercise”, “Stop”.

Follow along the exercises as instructed.

After finishing, review summary or history.

Adjust settings like voice, pace, or workout types as needed.

Future Enhancements

Add wearable integration (smartwatch, fitness band) for motion detection and heart rate feedback.

Use computer vision to monitor form (via webcam) and give corrective feedback.

Add gamification elements: badges, levels, leaderboards.

Implement adaptive learning: the system adjusts future workouts based on performance.

Support for offline or low-connectivity mode.

Multilingual & accent robustness improvements.
